        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
        Taste Trails is a virtual restaurant that opened for business in the start of 2024. It was created by a group of friends with a shared vision of bringing restaurant standard food 
        to people in the comfort of their own homes. 
        <br /> To be able to make an informed decision of what to eat with transparent information and easy to order menus. 
        <br /> All while not having to 
        deal with the hustle and bustle of a physical location – therefore any help the customer might need can be handled personally and professionally and most important, directly. 
        <br /> The company is based in Stockholm, Sweden and all of the founders come from a background in it-development and found each other through a common interest regarding the culinary 
        experience.

      <h2>As of today</h2>
      <p>
      Our virtual doors opened up for the first time the 16th of April 2024. Right now, we offer our customers a fine selection of hamburger and pasta – with suitable drinks to go with
      your meal. 
      <br /> Information regarding our recipes such as allergies, gluten, lactose and so on are all readily available as you decide what to order. 
      <br /> Our rating system in which you all have a say in is always updating to give you the most informed decision. You also have the option to see others feedback in form of comments 
      left by other customers and you can of course leave your own comments 
      <br /> to inform others, and us of what you think. 
      <br /> That way everyone's experiences can be as enjoyable as possible!

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
        Our goal is to expand to two more locations in Sweden by the end of 2025. One in Gothenburg and one in Malmö. 
        <br /> We plan to take all in all constructive criticism from all of you and 
        make this business and your experiences as wonderful as possible and set a new standard for all restaurant goers heading into the future. 
        <br /> Whether someone enjoys our impeccable 
        meals or decide to dine out somewhere – they should be able to have their enjoyment reach the golden standard that we hope to set for the industry. 
        <br /> Through our collaboration with you all in regard to what you need, demand and hope to get out from your valuable time. We will make sure to be at the forefront of 
        setting and following that standard.
